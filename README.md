Superheroes


## "SuperheroDataset.csv"
Data from "SuperheroDataset.csv" was used to make the fight model.

The superpowers in "super_hero_powers.csv" were analyzed after making the fight model to see which powers stand out.

"createinserts.py" calculates the fights between the superheroes/villains and creates insert statements, "insertstatements.sql", for a database in SQL.
